🧩 Technologies Used

⚙️ How It Works

The user enters their Name, Email, and Message in the form.

When the Submit button is clicked:

JavaScript checks if any field is empty.

If a field is missing, an error message is shown below the heading.

If all fields are filled, the form automatically redirects to home.html, displaying a success message
